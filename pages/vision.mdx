# Vision

To keep up with an increasingly complex world, we need to scale high quality decision making to a speed humans alone arenâ€™t capable of.

While many argue AI will bring about the end of humanity, we believe exactly the opposite: that AI will enable the systems critical to the flourishing of society.

Unfortunately, AI doomerism is contributing to a dangerous trend: the centralization of both AI development and model operations.

Fundamentally, we will be unable to responsibly place our trust in highly centralized superintelligence that is controlled by private companies, individuals, or even states.

To establish the trust necessary to facilitate true institutional replacement, the AI system must be open and verifiable, including all inputs and outputs. It also must be robust: reliable and resistant to manipulation.

We are building a system that is fully transparent, resilient, self-improving, and capable of making the key decisions required to run any type of organization.

Earthmind is a replacement for governance. Its capabilities will develop over time, evolving from governing protocols in the (ideal) test environment of cryptocurrencies, to managing real-world organizations and eventually legal jurisdictions.

Our vision is simple: **build and power truly autonomous, intelligent systems.**
