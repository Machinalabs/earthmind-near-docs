# Bittensor Subnet

The Earthmind subnet is intended to bootstrap the Earthmind decentralized governance network. Validators and miners of the subnet will operate what will become the first subnet of the eventual Earthmind network, earning both TAO rewards and Earthmind points. 

Each subnet on Earthmind is an entirely AI-run governance protocol, and directly governs an application layer protocol on a different blockchain. 

The first subnet, which is also the Bittensor subnet, is an AI “judge” that can rule on any governance proposal. Protocols can register with the Earthmind smart contract and include a system prompt and context. Miners will then listen to all registered protocols for proposals, and append the system prompt, context, and proposal text before computing inference and choosing “yes” or “no”. Validators then score the proposals, and the outcome of the proposal is then determined based on the combined scored weight of the “yes” or “no” votes from the miners.

The first protocol to use this mechanism is an AI-driven NFT collection, where artists propose the next NFT in the collection, and the AI governance collectively decides which proposals to include in the collection. The chosen NFTs are then minted as Bitcoin ordinals and auctioned off, with the proceeds split between the artist and the protocol (the validators and miners).
