# Architecture

In its simplest form, the EarthMind protocol is composed of 3 main elements:

- [EarthMind client contract]
- [EarthMind subnet]
- [Intelligence bridge]

The following image shows a high level overview of the EarthMind protocol architecture:

As we notice, the Intelligence bridge is responsible for the communication between Bittensor and Ethereum.

The following image shows a more detailed overview of the EarthMind protocol architecture:

We can see that validators in the [EarthMind subnet] are listening for new `Governance requests` from Consumer protocols. Then, they obtain intelligence from a network of Miners and rank them according to the Consumer protocol goals or as we called `culture`. To learn how to setup the consumer protocol goals and/or culture, review the [Smart contract integration] section.

Once validators have obtained intelligence from miners, they submit their responses to the [Intelligence bridge].

The Intelligence bridge is composed of a trustless Relayer and the EigenLayer AVS, together they both ensure the validator's messages are verified and then execute a call back to the Consumer protocol by aggregating the BLS signatures of the AVS nodes.
